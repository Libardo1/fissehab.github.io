Therefore, it is important to know techniques that enable us to combine data from various tables. In this blog post, let?s see how we can work with joins in Spark.

You can get part one [here](http://datascience-enthusiast.com/Python/big_data_spark_part1).\n\nHere, we will see inner, left outer, right outer, full outer, and other joins.\n\nWe will use the [FDA adverse events data](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm), which are publicly available. The FDA adverse events datasets can be downloaded in .csv format from the [National Bureau of Economic Research](http://www.nber.org/data/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-data.html).\n The adverse events datasets are created in quarterly temporal resolution and each quarter data includes demography information, drug/biologic information, adverse event, outcome and diagnosis, etc. I downloaded the data for the fourth quarter of 2015 and uploaded it to [Databricks](https://databricks.com). Databricks have a free [community edition](https://databricks.com/try-databricks).

Inner join creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (A and B) based upon the join-predicate.
