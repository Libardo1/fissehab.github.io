<strong>Project App summary</strong>

This app calculates monthly climatology (long term mean) and trend of temperature 
and rainfall over any selected rectangular region. Temperature or rainfall dataset 
can be selected from the 'choose a dataset' input control on the top left of the sidebar.
The results for the region selected are displayed at the tabPanels at the bottom. 
The data can also be downloaded from the app. The rainfall and temperature data cover 
the time period from 1980-2013 and they are from the Climate Research Unit (CRU).
