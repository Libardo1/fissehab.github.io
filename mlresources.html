 This course introduces methods for five 
 key facets of an investigation: data wrangling, 
 cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;
 data management to be able to access big data quickly 
 and reliably; exploratory data analysis to generate 
 hypotheses and intuition; prediction based on statistical 
 methods such as regression and classification; and communication
 of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.</p>
